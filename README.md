## üöÄ The Problem MarketMind Solves

In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, creating high-quality product listings is a major bottleneck. Sellers spend hours:
* ‚úçÔ∏è Writing catchy titles and persuasive descriptions.
* üì∏ Detailing product features and specifications.
* üí∞ Researching competitors to set an optimal price.

**MarketMind automates this entire workflow.** It acts as an AI co-pilot for e-commerce sellers, reducing the time to create a compelling, market-ready listing from minutes to mere seconds.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **ü§ñ AI-Powered Content Generation:**
  * **Vision Analysis:** Upload an image, and Google's Gemini Vision model instantly identifies the product and its key attributes.
  * **LLM-Powered Copywriting:** A Large Language Model (Gemini) generates SEO-friendly titles, engaging descriptions, and concise bullet points.
  * **Smart Price Suggestion (RAG):** A practical implementation of **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**. The system retrieves current pricing for similar items online and uses this data to inform the AI's price suggestion.

* **‚öôÔ∏è Full SaaS Functionality:**
  * **Secure User Authentication:** Full registration and login system using JWT and password hashing (`bcrypt.js`).
  * **Credit-Based System:** Users get free credits on signup. Each AI generation consumes a credit, creating a real-world usage model.
  * **Payment Gateway:** Integrated with **Razorpay** to allow users to purchase more credits, making it a complete, monetizable platform for the Indian market.

* **üé® Modern & Animated UI:**
  * A sleek, professional frontend built with **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
  * Fluid animations and page transitions powered by **Framer Motion** for a premium user experience.
  * A central user dashboard to generate listings, view credit balance, and see creation history.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture & Workflow

This project demonstrates a robust MERN stack architecture integrated with external AI and payment services.

</div>

**Workflow Breakdown:**

1.  **Image Upload:** The user uploads a product image from the React frontend.
2.  **Backend Processing:** The Express.js server receives the image. The user's JWT is verified by a middleware to protect the route.
3.  **Credit Check:** The system checks the user's credit balance in the MongoDB database.
4.  **LLM Vision Call:** The image is sent to the **Google Gemini API**. The LLM analyzes the image and returns a text description of the product.
5.  **RAG for Pricing:**
    * **Retrieve:** The backend uses the product description from the LLM to perform a targeted web search for similar items using `axios` and `cheerio`.
    * **Augment:** The retrieved prices are processed and aggregated.
    * **Generate:** This pricing data, along with the product description, is passed back to the **Gemini LLM** in a new prompt, asking it to generate the final listing content and a suggested price.
6.  **Database Update:** The user's credit is decremented, and the newly generated listing is saved to MongoDB, linked to the user's ID.
7.  **Response:** The final listing data is sent back to the React frontend and displayed to the user with a smooth animation.
